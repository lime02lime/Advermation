# DEMO PROJECT: postgenius @ Fleete

**URL**: https://fleete-advertising.vercel.app/

## Overview
This is a demo of a website for internal use at Fleete, which allows users to generate engaging content for its social media pages. The content is generated using the OpenAI GPT API, which is fed context information about the company.

The website has 3 central features:
